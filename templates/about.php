				<p class="text-muted">I am excited and humbled to share what I have learned about nutrition. I want to give back to the community some of the knowledge I have accumulated throughout the years with research and trial and error. I feel like I can bring some insight to people who are not only curious about different supplements, but what can truly help them in the long run in order to live a healthy lifestyle. </p>
				<p class="text-muted">Nutrition is so very important in balancing out the body, so you can do things with a ‘well-oiled engine’. I really hope I can add some perspective, and I also hope that I can give back to you by sharing what I have gained. Please feel free to leave comments about anything. I will do my best to reply. I know that this site is a work in progress, but I want to take my time to thank you for coming to visit.</p>
